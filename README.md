# leaflet-challenge

This project is an interactive earthquake map built using Leaflet and D3. It pulls live data from the USGS and shows each earthquake as a circle on the map. The size of the circle shows how strong the quake was, and the color shows how deep it was. Clicking on a marker brings up more details like the location, magnitude, and depth. I also added a legend to help explain what the colors mean.

I had a few challenges while working on this, especially when trying to get the markers and legend to show up correctly. At one point I wasnâ€™t sure if the data was even loading, but after some trial and error and debugging the code, it started to come together. I feel like I learned a lot about how Leaflet and D3 work together, and now I actually understand the flow of how data turns into something visual on a map.

thank you for coming to my ted talk
